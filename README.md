# Office

As the team collaboration tool [Sqwiggle](https://www.sqwiggle.com/) seized to exist, we needed an
alternative for our remote team at Aircloak.

# Project status

Alpha level at best. We use it internally lacking a better alternative.
Feel free to use it for your own team if you want.

# Contributions

Contributions more than welcome. Please feel free to create pull-requests with bugfixes
and general improvements and new features.

# How to run

To start the office locally:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
